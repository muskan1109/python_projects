This repository is a collection of programs written for a Python module taken in university. The topics covered were data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, exceptions and data analysis using Python. <br>

Disclaimer: not all code is written by myself. The base code was provided by the module lead but the main algorithm was implemented by myself. 

* To run the programs:
```shell script
python3 <filename>
```

Below is a short description of each program and how to run each program:

**Program 1:** <br>
Using the turtle library to create different circle patterns. Includes 5 .py files. 

**Program 2:** <br>
Creating a Zambales dice game for a single user. Two die are thrown 5 times and the user wins if there is one or more instances of the same number being thrown. 

**Program 3:** <br>
Producing different chequerboard patterns (using black and white squares), including the cafe wall illusion. 

* Note: this program requires the EzGraphics package which can be downloaded here: http://www.ezgraphics.org/Software/Download

**Program 4:** <br>
Using the ezgraphics library to create an algorithm that produces a customizable quilt pattern using Truchet tiles. 

**Program 5:** <br>
Creating a simpler form of the Unix command 'grep'.

**Program 6:** <br>
Using steganography to encode and decode a secret message hidden in a file.
